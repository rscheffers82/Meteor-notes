# Notes | built on Meteor & React

![RS Notes | Mobile responsive app built on Meteor & React](https://github.com/rscheffers82/Meteor-notes/blob/master/public/images/responsive-overview-notes.jpg?raw=1)

### Where can I see this in action?
The app is deployed to Heroku, click [here](https://rs-notes.herokuapp.com) for a live demo.

### How to run the app locally?

This app requires you to have Meteor installed on your machine. Then you can clone the repo by clicking the above green button Clone. Once done run the following commands.
```
meteor npm install
```
```
npm start
```

### What about a test suite?

Front-end, back-end and API tests are included.<br/>
Running the tests is easy. All you have to do is run the following command and view the reporter at localhost port 3000.
```
npm test
```
